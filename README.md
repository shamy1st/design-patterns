# Design Patterns

### Behavioural

[Memento](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-memento-java) restoring an object to a previous state (undo).

[State](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-state-java) object behaviour changes based on its state.

[Iterator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-iterator-java)

[Strategy](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-strategy-java)

[Template Method](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-template-java)

[Command](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-command-java)

[Observer](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-observer-java)

[Mediator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-mediator-java)

[Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-chain-of-responsibility-java)

[Visitor](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-visitor-java)

### Structural
[Composite](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-composite-java)

[Adapter](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-adapter-java) converting interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

[Decorator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-decorator-java) add additional behavior to an object.

[Facade](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-facade-java) provide a simple interface to a complex system.

[Flyweight](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-flyweight-java) object share data as possible with similar objects to minimize memory usage.

[Bridge](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-bridge-java) 

[Proxy](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-proxy-java) 

### Creational
