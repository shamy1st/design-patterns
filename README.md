# Design Patterns

**Design Pattern** elegant solution to repeating problem. / Design reusable, extensible object-oriented software.
Book: [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
***
**Creational** (way to create objects)
* [Abstract Factory]()
* [Builder]()
* [Factory Method]()
* [Prototype]()
* [Singleton]()
* [Object Pool]()

**Structural** (relationship between objects)
* [Adapter](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-adapter-java) converting interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
* [Bridge](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-bridge-java) connect two independent hierarchies, build a simple yet flexible hierarchy.
* [Composite](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-composite-java) describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance.
* [Decorator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-decorator-java) add additional behavior to an object.
* [Facade](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-facade-java) provide a simple interface to a complex system.
* [Flyweight](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-flyweight-java) object share data as possible with similar objects to minimize memory usage.
* [Proxy](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-proxy-java) create a proxy "agent" from a real object.

**Behavioural** (interaction between objects)
* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-chain-of-responsibility-java) build a pipeline of processing objects for a request.
* [Command](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-command-java) object used to perform an action at a later time. / Button, click()
* [Interpreter]()
* [Iterator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-iterator-java) iterating over an object without exposing the internal structure. / BrowserHistory, loop through Urls
* [Mediator](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-mediator) object encapsulates how a set of objects interact. / DialogBox(ListBox, TextBox, Button)
* [Memento](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-memento) restoring an object to a previous state (undo). / Editor, undo() mechanism
* [Observer](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-observer-java)
* [State](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-state-java) object behaviour changes based on its state.
* [Strategy](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-strategy-java)
* [Template Method](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-template-java)
* [Visitor](https://github.com/shamy1st/design-pattern-visitor-java)
